an app about a graph
====================

## Now

- [ ] prediction based on: for every day  min([T-2, T]) > max([T-8, T-3]) + 0.2 and also guarantee we have all numbers.

- [ ] Fix slider label position
- [ ] Add input to mark down day
- [ ] Gradient stop on an arbitrary number

*bugs*

- [ ] fill missing data with fake points to avoid errors?
- [ ] adding past points adds them in input order, not cronological

## Next

- [ ] mail/share reading data

## Later

- [ ] upload data
- [ ] correct colors

## Done

- [x] load stored data to graph
- [x] data persistence
